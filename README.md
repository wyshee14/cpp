## Orthodox Canonical Form
- Default constructor: used to initialize objects with default values
- Copy constructor: Used to initialize a new object as a copy of an existing object, passing an object by value or duplicate an object
- Assignment operator: used to assign the value of one object to another existing object (handle deep copy and self assignment)
- Destructor: used to delete an object when out of scope

## Polymorphism
### Compile time polymorphism
- Function overloading : same function name which have different parameter type
- Operator overloading : operator works different on how we defined it to be
### Run time polymorphism
- Function overriding : use `virtual`
